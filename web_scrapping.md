# **Web Scraping Overview: Cricket Data Analytics**

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites and saving it for further analysis. In this project, I used **Bright Data** to scrape cricket-related data from **ESPNcricinfo** to assemble the best playing eleven for cricket analytics.

## **Tools and Methods Used**

### **Bright Data**
1. **Data Collector**:
   - Bright Data's Data Collector was used to automate the extraction of cricket stats and player performance data from ESPNcricinfo.
   - It helps simplify large-scale data collection and is user-friendly.

2. **Interaction Code**:
   - A custom interaction code was written to simulate user interactions like clicking, scrolling, and navigating through pages on ESPNcricinfo.

3. **Parser Code**:
   - The parser was designed to convert the scraped data into a JSON file format for structured analysis and ease of use.

### **Inspecting ESPNcricinfo HTML**
To locate the relevant data:
- Open the ESPNcricinfo page in your browser.
- **Right-click > Inspect** to analyze the structure of the HTML code and identify the data elements for scraping.

## **Steps to Process Scraped Data**

1. **Scrape Data**:  
   - The data was scraped from ESPNcricinfo using Bright Data.  
   - Refer to the provided **interaction code** and **parser code** in the `web_scrapping_codes` folder.

2. **Data Format**:  
   - Scraped data was collected in JSON format, ensuring it was well-structured.

3. **Transformations**:  
   - The JSON data can be loaded into Jupyter Notebook for cleaning and transformation.  
   - After processing, it can be converted into CSV files for analysis or visualization.

4. **Final Dataset**:  
   - The transformed data (now in CSV) was used to generate insights, build parameters, and create the best playing eleven team.
